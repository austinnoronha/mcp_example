# Get Started with MCP


## 1 Understand MCP Requirements

MCP (Model Collaboration Protocol) is a standard for making AI models, agents, or services interoperable. To be MCP-compatible, your service should:

- Expose a well-defined API (usually HTTP/REST or gRPC).
- Follow the MCP schema for requests and responses (often OpenAPI/JSON Schema).
- Provide metadata endpoints (capabilities, health, version, etc.).
- Support authentication (if required).
- Be discoverable and self-describing.

## 2. Assess Your Current State
You have:
- A Python project with APIs (src/apis/main.py).
- Supporting libraries and utilities.
- Dockerfile and docker-compose for containerization.

## 3. Plan to Meet MCP Requirements

### A. API Conformance
- Review MCP API specs: Find the official MCP OpenAPI spec or schema.
- Update your endpoints: Ensure your endpoints match the required paths, methods, and payloads.
- Implement required endpoints:
-- /v1/metadata (service info, capabilities)
-- /v1/health (health check)
-- /v1/infer or /v1/completions (main inference endpoint)
- Validate request/response formats: Use JSON Schema or OpenAPI validation.

### B. Metadata & Discovery
- Implement a metadata endpoint that describes your service, model, and capabilities.

### C. Health & Versioning
- Add a health check endpoint.
- Expose version information.

### D. Authentication (if needed)
- Add support for API keys, OAuth, or other required auth.

### E. Documentation
- Provide OpenAPI/Swagger docs.
- Add a README section on MCP compatibility.

### F. Containerization & Hosting
- Ensure your Dockerfile exposes the correct ports.
- Update docker-compose for environment variables, secrets, etc.
- Test locally, then deploy to your chosen host (cloud VM, container service, etc.).

### G. Testing
- Write tests to validate MCP compliance (request/response, error handling).
- Use MCP client tools or reference agents to test integration.

## Example Task List
- Review MCP protocol documentation and OpenAPI spec.
- Update your API endpoints to match MCP requirements.
- Implement /v1/metadata, /v1/health, and main inference endpoints.
- Validate request/response formats against MCP schemas.
- Add authentication if required.
- Update Dockerfile and docker-compose for deployment.
- Write and run MCP compliance tests.
- Document your MCP endpoints and usage.
- Deploy and test with an MCP agent.

## How Would the MCP Agent Know How to Use This?
- The MCP agent will look for the standard endpoints (/v1/metadata, /v1/health, /v1/infer).
- It will read your metadata endpoint to understand your serviceâ€™s capabilities.
- It will send requests in the MCP format and expect responses in the MCP schema.
- If you provide OpenAPI docs, the agent (or its developers) can auto-generate clients or validate integration.
